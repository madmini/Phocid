A modern offline music player with familiar designs for Android 11+.

This project aims to be a replacement with personal tweaks for the now-defunct https://github.com/kabouzeid/Phonograph[Phonograph] music player, but has no connections with it.

Phocid is not officially available on Google Play or other app stores except https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.sunsetware.phocid/[F-Droid]. I don't provide support for unauthorized repackaged versions, and you should report repackagers who violate GPL.

== Features

* Familiar user experience
* Better metadata support; Namely, multiple artists.
* Better sorting when your music library differs from your system language
* Regex-based blocklist
* Playback speed and pitch control
* More lyrics styles
* Optional less-vibrant colors
* Brand new design based on Material Design 3

== Missing features compared to Phonograph

=== Features that are intentionally left out

* Tag editing
+
The scene of audio file tagging is a disaster.
The best metadata support library I could find is still buggy; I recommend using well-known dedicated software for this task.
* Deleting files
* Anything that requires an internet connection
* Lock screen

=== Features that might be added

These features are hard to implement and/or of no personal interest.
If you want to see a feature, please https://github.com/TJYSunset/Phocid/issues[file an issue].

* Playback statistics
* Widgets
* Notification customization

== Known issues

* Expect hangs or crashes when having a large number of tracks queued.
This is an upstream issue at https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/81.
* Phocid consumes more system resources than other players, and the UI occasionally stutters.

== Troubleshooting common problems

First of all, please try https://github.com/tjysunset/phocid/releases/latest[the latest release] from GitHub.
F-Droid updates can lag behind for as long as 7 days.
GitHub and F-Droid builds have the same signature, which means you don't have to uninstall when switching download source.

=== Playback is misbehaving

Disable "Audio offloading" in preferences.

=== Metadata are incorrect / embedded lyrics not showing

Enable "Advanced metadata extraction" in preferences.

=== Unwanted files are listed

See "Indexing help" in preferences.
Apparently a lot of people miss that button.

== Reporting a crash

A crash report should have been saved to `Android/data/org.sunsetware.phocid/files/crash.txt` in your external storage.
Please https://github.com/TJYSunset/Phocid/issues[create an issue] with the report attached.

NOTE: Depending on your system, you might need to connect your phone to a computer to see this file.

== Building

Remember to clone the submodule with `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

== Contributing

Please ask first if you want to work on big code changes.
Instead of directly contributing code to Phocid, it would be great if you can help with big upstream issues first, like https://bitbucket.org/ijabz/jaudiotagger/issues/65/add-support-for-ogg-opus-format or https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/81. (Please let me know if you have successfully closed those!)

If you would like to help with translations, see https://github.com/TJYSunset/Phocid/issues/1[issue #1].
Please don't submit machine translations or AI hallucinations.

I don't accept donations.
